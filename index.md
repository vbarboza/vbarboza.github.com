## About Me

I hold a B.Eng degree in Computer Engineering from [State University of Campinas](http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english), ranked 1st in [Times Higher Education Latin America University Rankings 2017](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/latin-america-university-rankings).

In my Junior years, I have been involved in X-Ray and Synchrotron X-Ray Microtomography image processing research at UNICAMP and the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory ([LNLS](http://www.lnls.cnpem.br/)). Our results have been published [here](https://biotechnologyforbiofuels.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13068-015-0229-8).

The undegraduate research has given me an opportunity to work as an intern at the Brazilian Nanotechnology Light Laboratory ([LNNano](http://lnnano.cnpem.br/)), where I developed [Gwyddion](gwyddion.net) modules to the [Laboratory for Surface Science](http://lnnano.cnpem.br/laboratories/lcs/) and contributed with a few patches like an [Otsu's threshold implementation](https://sourceforge.net/p/gwyddion/code/15479) and [bugfixes](https://sourceforge.net/p/gwyddion/code/16000). My work here was used for [this publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25338749).
