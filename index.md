## About me

Human being, husband, dog person and cat owner working as an R&D Engineer at [Timpel](http://www.timpelmedical.com) - a medical devices company - mainly with embedded Linux, having experience on Image Processing, databases, Shell scripting, C, C#, Java, Python, Octave/MATLAB, kernel development and free and open-source software projects.

### Education

B.Eng degree in Computer Engineering from [State University of Campinas](http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english), ranked 1st in [Times Higher Education Latin America University Rankings 2017](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/latin-america-university-rankings).

### Work

I have been involved in industrial X-Ray and Synchrotron X-Ray Microtomography image processing research at UNICAMP and the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory ([LNLS](http://www.lnls.cnpem.br)) as an undergraduate. Our results have been published [here](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-015-0229-8).

The undegraduate research has given me an opportunity to work as an intern at the Brazilian Nanotechnology Light Laboratory ([LNNano](http://lnnano.cnpem.br)), where I developed [Gwyddion](htt://www.gwyddion.net) modules to the [Laboratory for Surface Science](http://lnnano.cnpem.br/laboratories/lcs) and contributed with a few patches like an [Otsu's threshold implementation](https://sourceforge.net/p/gwyddion/code/15479) and bugfixes like [this](https://sourceforge.net/p/gwyddion/code/16000). I also investigated Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) image artifacts and contributed to technical and [scientific publications](https://doi.org/10.1088/0957-4484/25/45/455603).

By the end of my graduation, I was hired as a Software Engineer at [Eldorado](http://www.eldorado.org.br/eldorado/?lang=en), working with Image Processing and Computer Vision R&D projects. Our team tackled precision agriculture problems with Python and Machine Learning on infrared images. Furthermore, I was involved in a research about fingerprint singular point extraction at the Institute of Computing in UNICAMP.

Then, as soon as I graduated I received an offer from [Credit Suisse](https://br.credit-suisse.com/site/index.seam) to move to SÃ£o Paulo and work as a Software Engineer. There, I was responsible for designing and developing an SQL database application integrating systems from other areas in middle-office and back-office as funds management, operations and compliance. Currently, my software attends to more than 400 investment funds, supporting cashflow visualization, portfolio simulations and regulatory guidelines compliance.

By the end of the year, I accepted a call to work with R&D again, developing embedded software for a national startup on medical devices industry. Our electrical impedance tomograph provides real-time images and measurements of regional distribution of ventilation at bedside, without radiation.
