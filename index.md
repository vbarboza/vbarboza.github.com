## About me

Full-time husband and cat owner, ~~no-time piano, synths & keyboards~~ working with Research and Development at [IDwall](http://www.idwall.co). I code Python for web backend and image processing algorithms, also having experience on embedded Linux, kernel development, C, Shell scripting, and free and open-source software projects.

### Education

B.Eng degree in Computer Engineering from [State University of Campinas](http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english), ranked 1st in [Times Higher Education Latin America University Rankings 2017](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/latin-america-university-rankings).

### Work

I have been involved in industrial X-Ray and Synchrotron X-Ray Microtomography image processing research at UNICAMP and the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory ([LNLS](http://www.lnls.cnpem.br)) as an undergraduate. Our results have been published [here](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-015-0229-8).

The undegraduate research has given me an opportunity to work as an intern at the Brazilian Nanotechnology Light Laboratory ([LNNano](http://lnnano.cnpem.br)), where I developed [Gwyddion](htt://www.gwyddion.net) modules to the [Laboratory for Surface Science](http://lnnano.cnpem.br/laboratories/lcs) and contributed with a few patches like an [Otsu's threshold implementation](https://sourceforge.net/p/gwyddion/code/15479) and bugfixes like [this](https://sourceforge.net/p/gwyddion/code/16000). I also investigated Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) image artifacts and contributed to technical and [scientific publications](https://doi.org/10.1088/0957-4484/25/45/455603).

By the end of my graduation, I was hired as a Software Engineer at [Eldorado](http://www.eldorado.org.br/eldorado/?lang=en), working with Computer Vision R&D projects. Furthermore, I was involved in a research about fingerprint biometrics at the [Institute of Computing](https://ic.unicamp.br/en) in UNICAMP.

As soon as I graduated I started working as a Software Engineer at [Credit Suisse](https://br.credit-suisse.com/site/index.seam) in SÃ£o Paulo. Being responsible for integrating middle-office and back-office systems for managing investiment funds, operations and regulations. Currently my software supports hundreds of investment funds, checking for regulatory compliance guidelines.

Later that year, I was working with R&D at [Timpel](http://www.timpelmedical.com/) - a medical devices company - developing embedded software for an electrical impedance tomograph which provides real-time images and measurements of pulmonary function.

Nowadays I work with R&D at [IDwall](http://www.idwall.co) - a brazilian startup which offers document validation, background check, and identity verification solutions and services - developing web applications and image processing algorithms.

### Projects

My main interests are ~~cats,~~ audio and music, science, Linux kernel and embedded development and Image Processing related projects.

* [octave-fingercode](https://www.github.com/vbarboza/octave-fingercode) is a fingerprint matching algorithm I have implemented in MATLAB and intended to port to Octave.
* [python-fingercode](https://www.github.com/vbarboza/python-fingercode) is a Python implementation of the same algorithm in a Jupyter notebook.
* [sublime-ecl](https://github.com/vbarboza/sublime-ecl) is an ECL syntax highlighting plugin for Sublime I developed for the HPCC community.
* [space-invaders-vhdl](https://www.github.com/vbarboza/space-invaders-vhdl) is a simple hardware description language implementation of Space Invaders.
* [minigl](https://github.com/vbarboza/minigl) is a small game engine written in Ruby by a friend with whom I contribute.

You can also find programming exercises and presentations in there. Oh, and my alternative Munchkin rules!
